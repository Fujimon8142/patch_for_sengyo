# Sengyo Patch for Steel Diver: Sub Wars

## Introduction
This repository contains a patch that fixes an issue in the game 'Steel Diver: Sub Wars', specifically related to 'Sengyo'. 'Sengyo' is short for 'Senkai Gyorai', a phenomenon that occurs when a player is turning and firing a torpedo. The spawn position of the torpedo appears to be different between its owner (the one who fires it) and other players.

You can watch a video about this issue [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx3cfT59XwA). The video shows, from left to right, the perspective of a torpedo observer with the patch applied, a torpedo observer without the patch, and the torpedo's owner.

## Usage
To apply this patch, please follow the steps below:

1. Download this repository.
2. Copy the 'luma' folder into your SD card.
3. Press the Select Button and power on your 3DS.
4. Enable 'game patching' in the Luma3DS configuration menu.
5. Press the Start Button to save and reboot your 3DS.
6. Launch 'Steel Diver: Sub Wars' and fire a torpedo in multiplayer mode.

If everything is done correctly, the patch should work well.

## Structure
Unfortunately, I can't provide details about the structure of this patch. This is because I am afraid to unintentionally prevent the development of a new 'Steel Diver' game that may be in the works.
